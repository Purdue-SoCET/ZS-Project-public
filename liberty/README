The standard cells have been characterized using CharLib. CharLib is an open-source software that uses NGSpice and a single YAML configuration file to characterize a provided set of standard cells. Upon successful completion of characterization, the software produces a Liberty-format file that is required for synthesis. To test the Liberty file, we use an open-source synthesis tool, Yosys, to attempt synthesis using the produced Liberty file. The .yml files in this directory are the configuration files read by CharLib. They were created for the AS800 process and the cells were successfully characterized, creating the .lib files. Both .lib files include necessary changes for compatibility with Yosys and a design with both combinational and sequential elements has been successfully synthesized using the .lib files.

For more information on software setup for CharLib, NGSpice, Yosys, and other required environments and libraries, SoftwareSetup.txt provides a detailed description of the entire setup process.

For more information on running a characterization and synthesizing using the Liberty file, CharacterizationTutorial.txt provides a description of how to use CharLib to characterize a set of standard cells and how to use Yosys to synthesize using the produced Liberty file. The tutorial also includes information on necessary changes to the Liberty file to make it compatible with Yosys.
