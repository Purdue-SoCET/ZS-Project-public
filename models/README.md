#Spice Models
CharLib, the open-source standard cell characterizer we used, requires SPICE files to characterize cells. Within this folder contains [model.sp](https://github.com/Purdue-SoCET/ZS-Project-public/blob/main/models/model.sp), a SPICE file for the nmos and pmos used. The other files, [NMOS_Spice_LEVEL7](https://github.com/Purdue-SoCET/ZS-Project-public/blob/main/models/NMOS_Spice_LEVEL7.txt) and [PMOS_Spice_LEVEL7](https://github.com/Purdue-SoCET/ZS-Project-public/blob/main/models/PMOS_Spice_LEVEL7) are the individual SPICE files for the nmos and pmos used in the cells we characterized.
