This project aims to test the viability of Open-Source EDA tools by using them to synthesize a RISC-V CPU core designed by SoCET. The project collaborates with AcuSemi and uses their AS800 process, an 800nm technology node designed for educational and demonstration purposes, to create a standard cell library. Our first steps, designing schematics for basic CMOS logic gates using XSCHEM and running SPICE simulations to confirm the functionality, have been completed. Additionally, we created layouts for each standard cell in KLayout with Design Rule Check and Layout vs. Schematic checks. IO Pads are also being tested in Xschem with ESD protection. Parameterized cells have been designed within the PCell script, supporting layout development. The standard cell library has been built using CharLib, an open-source standard cell characterizer, to generate liberty format files for use with OpenLane, an automated RTL to GDSII flow. OpenLane includes tools to complete synthesis, place & route, and verification, that are abstracted into just a single configuration file. OpenROAD, the routing placement platform, which is OpenLaneâ€™s backend, is used to generate configuration files for the AS800 technology from existing standard cells and process, and to validate the functionality with two metal layers.
