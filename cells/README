Standard cells, such as logic gates, flip flops, and IO pads, have been created using Xschem as the schematic capture tool. Functionality of these cells have been tested with Ngspice. The layout of the cells have been created as well using KLayout with AS800 technology. The IO pads are specifically designed so that they serve as a crucial interface between a chip's internal circuitry and the outside. They have ESD protection attached as well to protect the circuit from any damage caused by electrostatic discharge. 

In each cell's folder, the spice model and layout files can be found. Ngspice, Xschem, and KLayout can be used in order to make changes to these files.
